<h3 align="center">Hi! I'm Emma.</h3>
<h4 align="center">I'm a software engineer based in Tulsa, OK.</h4>

:butterfly: I’m currently working on this [adorable self-care app](https://github.com/self-care-bear/self-care-bear).
<br>
:bug: And if you want to check out some of my other projects... [PIXL](https://github.com/PIXLAPP/pixel-art-project) + [BYOBee](https://github.com/BYOBee-Project/BYOBee)
<br>
:ant: I’m currently learning backend - Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express. Blowing my mind.
<br>
🐝: When I'm not at the computer, you can find me outside bee-watching, inside Nicolas Cage-watching, reading (currently going through the Malazan Book of the Fallen), and taking fat naps with my cats.
