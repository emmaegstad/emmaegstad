:ant: I’m currently learning backend - Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express. Blowing my mind.

:beetle: When I'm not at the computer, you can find me outside looking for bees, working my way through the filmography of Nicolas Cage, reading (currently going through the Malazan Book of the Fallen), and taking fat naps.
