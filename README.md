## Hi! I'm Emma.
### A software engineer in Tulsa, OK.

- :butterfly: I’m currently working on this [adorable self-care app](https://github.com/self-care-bear/self-care-bear).
- :bug: And be sure to check out my most recent projects: [PIXL](https://github.com/PIXLAPP/pixel-art-project) + [BYOBee](https://github.com/BYOBee-Project/BYOBee)
- :ant: I’m currently learning backend - Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express. Blowing my mind.
- :bee: You can reach me at emma@egstad.com or on Twitter at @emmaegstad
- :beetle: When I'm not at the computer, you can find me outside looking for bees, working my way through the filmography of Nicolas Cage, reading (currently going through the Malazan Book of the Fallen), and taking fat naps.
